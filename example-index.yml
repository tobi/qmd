# You can manually edit this file - changes take effect immediately.

# Model overrides (optional - defaults work well for most use cases)
# models:

#   embed_format: "embeddinggemma"  # auto-detected from model name if omitted
#   rerank: "hf:ggml-org/Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B-Q8_0-GGUF/qwen3-reranker-0.6b-q8_0.gguf"
